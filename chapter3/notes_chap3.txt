- Had to remove feed http://feeds.feedburner.com/hotair/main, was getting error on blog name
- Code on github is different from the book
- Couldn't go further PIL library, had problems with it on Mac (no JPG). Went read-only after that to be able to finish the chapter
- why the "if len(bestmatches[i]) > 0:" on line 260? Is it to avoid changing the cluster to 1st k-cluster when it's already there?
- number of iterations:
  - k-cluster: up to 100
  - h-cluster: n_words
- why is k-cluster better than h-cluster (Mathematicaly speaking)? Intuitively it is, but what are the calculations to say that?
